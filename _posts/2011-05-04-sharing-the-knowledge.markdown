As you might know from our [website](http://webspecies.co.uk/) we work with a lot of different technologies, tools and projects. For example when building the website we used all the best from HTML5 and CSS3. It only makes sense for us to share our experiences to help others build things faster and better. This is the reason why we have created this blog - sharing our knowledge.

<!--more-->

It’s my promise to you that you won’t find any company-related content or advertisement of our products in this blog. As you might have seen, we have a [news section](http://webspecies.co.uk/news) for this in our website and that’s where all that is going to be talked about. Blog on the other hand is mainly for developers and designers, so the content here is going to be very technical and thus different. 

Our point of view is quite similar to the one of a company called 37signals, which is talked about in this [talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks2saa38Id4):

We are not afraid to put out what we know best. Hey, most of the stack we use is already open-source so why not contribute back by blogging about it? Of course without revealing security mechanisms and unique algorithms, but if we solved HTML5 History API usage problems we are going to share it. In turn hopefully this will also bring us a couple new clients, that would be great.

This is just an introductory post, but the bare minimum we are going to do is one blog post per week, so make sure to subscribe our [RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/WebSpeciesBlog) and leave comments. I’ll see you soon!
